## Project Overview

`meaty-frontend` is the user interface for the `meaty-backend`, a robust e-commerce platform designed for the sale of cannabis for both medical and recreational purposes. It offers a responsive, user-friendly experience that allows users to browse and purchase cannabis products seamlessly.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up the project on your local machine for development purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

Bun is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime that you will use to manage dependencies and run the project.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/meaty-frontend.git

   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```

This will start the local development server and open up a browser window to view the application. The server will reload if you make edits to any of the source files.
